      "<Hit {'content': 'US imports of crude oil from the Amazon are driving the destruction of some of the rainforest ecosystem?s most pristine areas and releasing copious amounts of greenhouse gases, according to a new report. The study, conducted by environmental group Amazon Watch, found that American refineries processed 230,293 barrels of Amazon crude oil a day last year. And California, despite its green reputation, refines an average of 170,978 barrels, or 7.2m gallons, of Amazon crude a day, with the Chevron facility in El Segundo accounting for 24% of the US total alone. The expansion of planned oil drilling poses ?one of the most serious threats? to the western region of the Amazon, with most of the oil originating from Ecuador, Peru and Colombia. While green groups have enjoyed some success in fighting the Amazon ambitions of large oil firms like Chevron, other players from countries such as China have moved in, with proposed oil and gas fields now covering 283,172 sq miles of the Amazon ? an area larger than Texas. Felling the carbon-rich trees of the Amazon produces greenhouse gases even before the oil is transported and burned, while indigenous communities and the Amazon?s vast trove of biodiversity are also at risk. Ecuador?s state oil company PetroAmazonas recently started drilling close to the Yasuni national park, which is considered to be one of the most biologically rich places on Earth. The park contains 655 endemic tree species ? more than the US and Canada combined ? as well as two of the last tribes in the world living in voluntary isolation. As oil interests seek to exploit areas of the Amazon, there are fears that indigenous communities will suffer from pollution, displacement and deadly illnesses due to a lack of acquired immunity. ?Our demand for Amazon crude is literally driving the expansion of the Amazon oil frontier and is putting millions of acres of indigenous territory and pristine rainforest on the chopping block, ? said Leila Salazar-Lopez, executive director of Amazon Watch. ?Breaking free from oil dependence and keeping remaining fossil fuels in the ground is an urgent, collective endeavor, and the life-giving Amazon rainforestmust be one of the first places we start.? After crude is refined in California and elsewhere it is distributed as diesel to vehicle fleets across the US. Adam Zuckerman, a California-based campaigner for Amazon Watch, said ?virtually every company, city and university in California and around the country contributes to the destruction of the Amazon rainforest.? California has burnished its environmental reputation with lofty goals to cut greenhouse gas emissions, boost energy efficiency and slash petroleum use in cars and trucks. Despite this, the state is dependent upon oil imports from countries such as Ecuador, in part because of clean energy policies that discriminate against the heavy grade oil produced by countries such as Canada. Meanwhile, an explosion at the ExxonMobil refinery in Torrance, California, in February 2015 caused the state to increase its gasoline imports to more than 10 times the typical level. Zuckerman said Amazon Watch wants California to consider human rights issues when it imports oil, as well as for ?no go zones? such as the Amazon basin to be established in decision making. Around 40 US businesses that use Amazon crude oil have been contacted by the NGO over the issue. A spokesman for California governor Jerry Brown did not answer whether new laws were being considered to reduce Amazon crude imports but said the administration has taken ?nation-leading action to fight climate change, decarbonize our economy and end our dangerous addiction to foreign oil?. A spokesman for the Western States Petroleum Association, which represents refineries in California, said the group did not wish to comment.', 'path': '332', 'title': 'US drives rainforest destruction by importing Amazon oil, study finds'}> 7.561618065154688\n",

The leak is about two and a half times smaller than the biggest North Sea spill in recent years, at Shell?s Gannet platform off Aberdeen in 2011. The spill from the Clair platform is being monitored from the air by plane which, combined with modelling, shows the oil moving away from land in a northerly direction. ?The most recent surveillance flight already indicates significant dispersal of the oil at the surface,? the company said in a statement. The government estimates the leak could involve more than 1,300 barrels but claims it has been greatly reduced Read more The platform, 46 miles (75km) west of Shetland, was shut down following the spill on Sunday at about 10am. The leak was caused by a technical issue with a system designed to separate the mixed production fluids of water, oil and gas, the company said following an investigation. BP believes that allowing the oil to disperse naturally at sea is the best way to deal with the spill, although other options have not been ruled out. In a statement, it said: ?The release was stopped within an hour once the issue had been identified and Clair production was taken offline.? Oil spill and environmental experts from BP, Oil Spill Response Limited and the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy are said to have been working to assess any potential impact of the spill on the environment.

Cushing City Manager Steve Spears said 40 to 50 buildings were damaged in Sunday\\'s earthquake, which was the third in Oklahoma this year with a magnitude of 5.0 or greater. No major injuries have been reported, and Spears said the damage included cracks to buildings and fallen bricks and facades. Oklahoma has had thousands of earthquakes in recent years, with nearly all traced to the underground injection of wastewater left over from oil and gas production. Sunday\\'s quake was centered 1 mile west of Cushing and about 25 miles south of where a magnitude 4.3 quake forced a shutdown of several wells last week. Fearing aftershocks, police cordoned off older parts of the city about 50 miles northeast of Oklahoma City to keep gawkers away late Sunday, and geologists confirmed that several small quakes have rumbled the area. Spears said an assisted living community had been evacuated after damage was reported. The Cushing Public School District canceled Monday classes. The Oklahoma Department of Transportation reported Sunday night that no highway or bridge damage was found within a 15-mile radius of the earthquake\\'s epicenter. The quake struck at 7:44 p.m. Sunday and was felt as far away as Iowa, Illinois and Texas. The U.S. Geological Survey initially said Sunday\\'s quake was of magnitude 5.3 but later lowered the reading to 5.0. \"I thought my whole trailer was going to tip over, it was shaking it so bad,\" said Cushing resident Cindy Roe, 50. \"It was loud and all the lights went out and you could hear things falling on the ground. \"It was awful and I don\\'t want to have another one.\" Cushing\\'s oil storage terminal is one of the world\\'s largest. As of Oct. 28, tank farms in the countryside around Cushing held 58.5 million barrels of crude oil, according to data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration. The community bills itself as the \"Pipeline Crossroads of the World.\" Cushing Assistant City Manager Jeremy Frazier said two pipeline companies had reported no trouble as of late Sunday but that the community hadn\\'t heard from all companies. Gov. Mary Fallin tweeted that no damage was reported at the storage tanks at Cushing\\'s oil storage terminal Megan Gustafson and Jonathan Gillespie were working at a Cushing McDonald\\'s when the quake hit. \"It felt like a train was going right through the building, actually,\" Gustafson, 17, said Sunday night as she and her co-workers stood behind a police barricade downtown, looking for damage. \"I kind of freaked out and was hyperventilating a bit.\" Gillespie said the building shook for about 10 seconds, but that he wasn\\'t as alarmed as Gustafson because he lives in an area that has experienced multiple earthquakes, especially in recent years. \"I didn\\'t think it was anything new,\" he said. According to USGS data, there have been about two dozen earthquakes in Oklahoma in the past week. When particularly strong quakes hit, the Oklahoma Corporation Commission directs well operators to cease wastewater injections or reduce volume. A 5.8 earthquake -- a record for Oklahoma -- hit Pawnee on Sept. 3. Shortly afterward, geologists speculated on whether the temblor occurred on a previously unknown fault. \"I was at home doing some work in my office and, basically, you could feel the whole house sway some,\" Spears, the Cushing city manager, said Sunday night. \"It\\'s beginning to become normal.\"', 'path': '275', 'title': 'Substantial damage after earthquake rattles major Oklahoma oil hub'}> 6.764671246706205\n",

Efforts are being made by the Heiltsuk to help recover this protected species. Divers also discovered schools of juvenile herring around the sunken Nathan E. Stewart tugboat. The outer boom which was put in place to contain the spilled oil had broke free on Friday causing the oil to spread and bad weather had prevented clean up crews from working on the spill for four consecutive days. By Saturday, salvage crews had recovered more than 40 percent of the 200,000 liters of fuel estimated to be in the vessel, but the damage had already been done. Mike Reid, the Heiltsuk Aquatics Manager said that there is an increased concern about the marine life in the Gale Passage. This is an extremely sensitive ecological and marine rescue area and there is a crucial herring spawning area which is located at the south end of the passage. ?In the first week of the spill, we had the largest tides of the month at 17.4 feet,? he said in a release. ?Even without bad weather, the speed of tides rushing through the spill site are likely to flush diesel into the area.?

Volunteers who are helping the tens of thousands of people who have lost homes to flooding say few people have said they are definitely leaving the state. But it is a topic of discussion among many people. \"I think everybody is still in shock. But they\\'re in a holding pattern until they see what help might be available,\" said Janet Rhodus, head of a Louisiana non-profit who has been volunteering in the flood area near Baton Rouge. When a state loses population, it\\'s a further drag on its economy, cutting into amount of money spent at its businesses or the taxes that can be collected to support needed government services. The population of Louisiana tumbled 6% in the year after hurricanes Katrina and Rita battered the area in 2005, and it took more than five years for the population to climb back to pre-storm levels. It\\'s unlikely Louisiana will face an exodus on that scale this year. Flood victims have not been sent to out-of-shelters like they were following the 2005 catastrophes. But the economy of Louisiana was stronger going into the 2005 storms, leaving some worried that some flood victims will be forced to move elsewhere this time. Part of the problem this time that could send people out of state is a shortage of available housing. The Baton Rouge housing market was already very tight before the storm, said Ginger Maulden, president-elect of the Greater Baton Rouge Association of Realtors. That housing crunch is going to get worse, she said. More than 60,000 homes are believed to have been damaged by flooding. \"Right now people are living with family members, trying to assess what has happened,\" she said. \"Rebuilding will be hard for a lot of people. A lot of people did not have flood insurance.\" Adding to the problem, Rhodus said, is the number of small businesses which have been closed due to the flooding and may not be able to reopen. That coupled with the loss of jobs in the oil industry in Louisiana in recent years due to the declining price of oil will make it difficult for some affected by flooding to find work. \"A number of businesses are not rebuilding at all,\" she said. \"People are going to have to relocate to find work and feed their families.\" Louisiana already has the fourth highest unemployment rate in the nation at 6.3%. It has lost 2,000 oil and gas drilling jobs in the last two years. \"An economy is generally left no worse off because of a natural disaster because of the aid and insurance money that comes in,\" said Mark Zandi, chief economist with Moody\\'s Analytics. \"But for an economy on the ropes, it may send people away, and that would make a bad situation worse.\"', 'path': '210', 'title': 'Next problem for flood-ravaged Louisiana: Population loss'}> 6.153813188263216\n",

As currently proposed, the Dakota Access pipeline would move oil out of northwestern North Dakota, through a 30-inch pipe, and along a 1,200-mile path that cuts through both Dakotas, Iowa, and a stretch of Illinois before meeting another pipeline in the town of Patoka. It would carrynearly half a million barrels of domestic sweet crude oil every day, and the project?s builder, Energy Transfer Partners, says it will bring back money. The Texas-based company says the pipeline will create up to 12,000 jobs (the Army Corps of Engineers approved the project and agreed) and generate over $120 million in property and income taxes every year. And they say it?ll be safer than moving the oil by train, the current option. The Standing Rock Sioux Tribe tells another story. The tribe, made up of Hunkpapa Lakota and Yanktonai Dakota, lives in the Standing Rock Indian Reservation, which covers parts of North and South Dakota. Members have been protesting the pipeline since April. They?re worried it might leak and contaminate wells along the pipe?s path, threatening their water supply. With the environmental protection group Earthjustice, the tribe filed suit against the Corps of Engineers in July, saying the Corps violated the Clean Water Act, the National Historic Protection Act, and the National Environmental Policy Act. In addition to water concerns, the suit says the ?pipeline crosses areas of great historical and cultural significance.? The protests simmered for months and exploded in early September, when video surfaced of private security using dogs and pepper spray on protesters. Since then, coverage of the protests has increased, with stories appearing on national news and even the Daily Show. A federal judge has halted the pipeline?s construction. A number of museum workers, historians, and archaeologists have encouraged the White House to order a more thorough review of the potential risk to artifacts. Standing Rock Sioux representatives recently addressed the United Nations Human Rights Commission. And the tribe is one of several in the U.S. and Canada to join an alliance against future oil pipelines. And the protest has grown. There are thousands of people from all over the country taking part. I spent three days with the Red Warrior Camp?a collective that believes in nonviolent direct action?and their allies.

The Dakotas have long been a site of conflict between Native Americans and the government. The history stretches from the brutal wars waged as settlers pushed west in the 19th century to the 1973 protest at Wounded Knee in South Dakota, when some 200 members of the American Indian Movement led an occupation and accused the U.S. government of not fulfilling its treaties with indigenous people.

Researchers from Harvard and Columbia universities in the US estimated there were more than 90,000 early deaths in Indonesia in areas closest to haze-belching fires, and several thousand more in neighbouring Singapore and Malaysia. The new estimate, reached using a complex analytical model, is far higher than the previous official death toll given by authorities of just 19 deaths in Indonesia. ?If nothing changes, this killer haze will carry on taking a terrible toll, year after year,? said Greenpeace Indonesia forest campaign Yuyun Indradi. ?Failure to act immediately to stem the loss of life would be a crime.? A spokesman for Indonesia?s environment ministry did not immediately have any comment. Indonesian authorities have previously insisted they are stepping up haze-fighting efforts, through such actions as banning the granting of new land for palm oil plantations and establishing an agency to restore devastated peatlands. The haze is an annual problem caused by fires set in forest and on carbon-rich peatland in Indonesia to quickly and cheaply clear land for palm oil and pulpwood plantations. The blazes occur mainly on Indonesia?s western Sumatra island and the Indonesian part of Borneo, with monsoon winds typically blowing the haze over Singapore and Malaysia. But last year?s fires were among the worst in memory and cloaked large parts of the region in choking smog for weeks, causing huge numbers to fall ill and sending diplomatic tensions soaring. The new study to be published in journal Environmental Research Letters, which combined satellite data with models of health impacts from smoke exposure and readings from pollution monitoring stations, estimated that 100,300 had died prematurely due to last year?s fires across the three countries. They estimated there were 91,600 deaths in Indonesia, 6,500 in Malaysia and 2,200 in Singapore. Greenpeace hailed a ?groundbreaking? study they said for the first time gave a detailed breakdown of deaths from last year?s fires, but cautioned that the figure was a ?conservative estimate?. It only looked at health impacts on adults and the effect of dangerous fine-particulate matter, known as PM 2.5. It did not examine the effect on youngsters or of the other toxins produced by the blazes. In reality, infants are some of the most at risk from the haze, said Nursyam Ibrahim, from the West Kalimantan province branch of the Indonesian Medical Association on Borneo. ?We are the doctors who care for the vulnerable groups exposed to toxic smoke in every medical centre, and we know how awful it is to see the disease symptoms experienced by babies and children in our care,? said Ibrahim. The study found an increase in the number of fires in peatland and in timber concessions in 2015, compared to the last haze outbreak considered major, in 2006, and that the number of fires in palm oil plantations fell. Shannon Koplitz, a Harvard scientist who worked on the study, said she also hoped the model they had developed could help those involved with tackling the annual blazes make quick decisions ?as extreme haze events are unfolding?. Last year?s haze outbreak was the worst since 1997 due to a strong El Nino weather system, which created tinder-dry conditions in Indonesia and made peatland and forests more vulnerable to going up in flames.', 'path': '130', 'title': 'Haze from Indonesian fires may have killed more than 100,000 people ? study'}> 5.88327278362861\n",

      "<Hit {'content': 'As the Marrakesh Climate Talks begin in earnest this week, local and regional communities are keenly aware of what is at stake after record breaking temperatures this summer. This translates into dangerously hot weather for the region of this year?s climate talks. According to Climate Signals on July 21, Mitribah, Kuwait reported a maximum temperature of 54.0C, the hottest temperature ever recorded in the Eastern Hemisphere and the second hottest globally. This was followed on July 22nd, when Basrah, Iraq reached 53.4C. The journal Science, stated last week that even if warming is constrained to 2C above preindustrial times?which is the central goal of the Paris Agreement?the Mediterranean region would see changes never experienced during recorded history. Morocco could see increased temperatures and drought that would drive the southern deserts further north, displacing forests. Deserts would expand in the Middle East, pushing temperate forests higher into the mountains. Average temperatures in the region have already risen by 1.3C since the late 19th century, well above the world average of 0.85C, according to the study. This research follows a study earlier this year from NASA that found that the recent drought that began in 1998 in the eastern Mediterranean Levant region, which comprises Cyprus, Jordan, Lebanon, Palestine, Syria, and Turkey, is likely the worst drought of the past nine centuries. Although political progress has been made, with the Paris Agreement being ratified last week, this is not enough. The fossil fuel industry?s recklessness continues to push the planet to the brink of catastrophe. Quite simply time is not on our side. The accumulated impact of decades of carbon dioxide, released from burning of fossil fuels, is rapidly taking its toll on the planet. Temperatures have broken records in 2016 and are shocking scientists who believe that CO2 levels have now permanently passed the threshold of 400 parts per million (PPM), compared to 280 ppm in pre-industrial times, much too high to avoid dangerous impacts. To try and stem this worrying trend towards accelerated warming is to immediately stop building new fossil fuel projects, and fully invest in 100% renewable energy for all so we can phase out those already in use. Both pre and post- 2020 ambitions must be sharply increased. Investors and governments have a responsibility to both divest from climate destruction and accelerate the just transition to a 100% renewable energy economy. Fossil fuel subsidies But how can we have faith in our governments to take this action when they continue to hand nearly hundreds of billions of dollars in government subsidies to the coal, gas, and oil industries? Ending these subsidies would be a giant step towards solving the climate crisis saving gigatonnes of carbon dioxide emissions, and helping make clean energy cheaper than fossil fuels. In June more than 200 civil society organizations called on the G20 to phase out fossil fuel subsidies by 2020. But despite a commitment by G7 nations in May to end government financial support for oil, gas and coal by 2025, the wider G20 group was unable to agree on a deadline. Subsidies from G20 governments to fossil fuel production alone - excluding subsidies to consumers - averaged $444 billion annually in 2013 and 2014, according to a report by Oil Change International and the London-based Overseas Development Institute (ODI). If the situation with on-going financial subsidies isn?t worrying enough, the UN climate talks also allows the fossil fuel industry free reign in its halls. The fossil fuel industry is doing everything it can to protect its profits, including making sure its interests are represented in the policymaking arena. Last week, a new infographic by Corporate Accountability International revealed the true extent of the fossil fuel industry?s access to, and influence over the talks. This is unacceptable. The fossil fuel industry has to be kicked out of the climate talks so world leaders can take action for our future and do justice for the people already feeling its impacts. The climate movement will also continue to hold the oil, gas and coal industry accountable in groundbreaking legal action. In September 2015, the Philippine Reconstruction Movement and Greenpeace Southeast Asia filed a petition with the Philippines? Commission on Human Rights on behalf of 13 organisations and 20 individuals, requesting that the Commission investigate the role of carbon majors in causing climate change and ocean acidification. The Commission agreed to take up the case and recently served a petition on 46 fossil fuel companies including BP, Exxon, Shell and Peabody. This is not the only legal case against the dirty energy giants. In the US, state governments are investigating whether fossil fuel companies - including ExxonMobil - may have violated laws pertaining to fraud and deception, by actively undermining the science of climate change, even while they have known about the dangers since as early as 1977. One thing is clear, over the next two weeks and beyond, we need to hold the fossil fuel industry accountable for the harm it continues to cause. Our demand to world leaders meeting in Marrakech is this: stop new fossil fuel projects from being built. Redirect finance for a just transition to 100% renewable energy that can empower people across the globe.', 'path': '88', 'title': 'Dangerously Hot: Holding to account those harming communities in North Africa'}> 5.880020184401946\n",
